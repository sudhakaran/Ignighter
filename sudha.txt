Create A Repo
If you’ve found yourself on this page, we’re assuming you’re brand new to Git and GitHub. This guide will walk you through the basics and explain a little bit about how everything works along the way.
First: Create A Repo

Every time you make a commit with Git, it is stored in a repository (a.k.a. “repo”). To put your project up on GitHub, you’ll need to have a GitHub repository for it to live in.

    Create the README file

    In the prompt, type the following code:

    $ mkdir ~/Hello-World

    $ touch README

    Open the new README file found in your Hello-World directory in a text editor and add the text “Hello World!” When you are finished, save and close the file.
    Commit your README

    Now that you have your README set up, it“s time to commit it. A commit is essentially a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time. In the prompt, type the following code:
